# React front for todo app

### `npm start`
starts application in debug mode at port 3000

### `npm test`
Runs some very limited tests


## implimentation
This app is made with react supporting heavily on material-ui libraries. 

Applications creator is not expert on react so some methods used in this application may be qure crude.

Some of the documentation inside this app may be "useless" but I wanted to write them down to get a better understanding react architectures myself.

This application is mainly ran trough docker and using it directly in this folder should be used only in development or debugging.

There are some stupid solutions in some components. THis is because i was learning react as i wrote this. So hopefully my last written components are better than the first ones.
